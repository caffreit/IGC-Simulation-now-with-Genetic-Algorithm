# Triple-Gaussian
Computes and fits IGC profile for a material described by 3 Gaussians.
Each Gaussain distribution decribes a site type; Basal Plane Defect, Basal Plane, Edge.
The positions and widths of each gaussian can be changed.
IGC Surface Energy profile is computed for the site energies given for a range of Edge sites % (equivalent to changing the flake length).
The profiles are then fitted to a logistic function. Parameters are plotted in a variety of combinations, figures are then saved.
